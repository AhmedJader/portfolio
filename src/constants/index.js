    "Hey, I‚Äôm Ahmed Abduljader, a Computer Science student at York University with a passion for software development, AI, and all things tech.",
    "I could use this space to list my skills, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîyou can already guess that I spend most of my time coding, reading documentation, and working on projects. Instead, let me tell you what makes me different:",
    "When I‚Äôm not behind a screen, I‚Äôm in the gym pushing my limits‚Äîliterally. I started my fitness journey benching a humble 95 lbs, but through relentless progression, strategic training, and the right supplementation (yes, I dry scoop pre-workout and creatine), I‚Äôve hit a staggering 225 lbs bench press while maxing out the chest-fly machine (because let‚Äôs be honest, chest day is elite), whilst going from being dangerously underweight for my size, to putting on a whopping 20-30 pounds of muscle in under a year all around my body",
    "Over the past four years, I‚Äôve refined my own training philosophy, combining compound strength movements with cable-based isolation work to optimize muscle growth and performance. Understanding how my body responds to different training styles is a process I approach scientifically‚ÄîJUST like coding.",
    "why did I choose to describe myself in this out-of-the-norm manner? Because this is how I perceive situations, it's a glimpse into how I plan out my goals, achieve my ambitions, and it's more than 'I like developing just cuz'.",
    "Whether it‚Äôs engineering robust software solutions or perfecting my physique, I‚Äôm always analyzing, iterating, and improving, and simply showcasing ONE of my hobbies has hopefully exposed you to who I am behind the screen.",
    "If you‚Äôre into software development, AI, or pushing limits (in tech or the gym), let‚Äôs connect! I‚Äôm always open to learning, collaborating, and discussing ambitious ideas.",
